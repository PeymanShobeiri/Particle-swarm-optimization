# Particle-swarm-optimization
This repository contains implementations of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and its applications to classic optimization problems. PSO is a metaheuristic optimization algorithm that is inspired by the social behavior of animal flocking. In PSO, a swarm of particles moves through a search space to find the optimal solution to a problem.

<h2> Algorithms </h2>

The repository contains Matlab implementations of the following classic optimization problems using PSO:
* Economic Dispatching
* Traveling Salesman Problem(TSP)
* Curve Fitting
* Binary Knapsack Problem
* Integer Knapsack Problem
* Path Planning

<h2> Usage </h2>

To use the PSO algorithms and test on classic problems, you can simply clone the repository and run the pso.m file in the corresponding problem directory. You can also modify the parameters of the PSO algorithm, such as the swarm size, maximum iterations and etc.

<h2> Acknowledgments </h2> 

This repository is inspired by the PSO algorithm introduced by Eberhart and Kennedy in their seminal paper "Particle Swarm Optimization" (1995) and builds on the work of other researchers in the field of metaheuristic optimization.
